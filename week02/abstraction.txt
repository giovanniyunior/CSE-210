Highlight a benefit of Abstraction.
Provide an application of Abstraction.

Abstraction is a way to difine an achitecture in our code that ocganize and make the code more scalable,
With Abstraction we can create different classes and separate the logic of a program, that help us to optimize the code and to handle eventual changes
In this week activity we write aproram abour a resume, and we create a class called Job, and this class had a method called display(), this method help me to reduce the code and I could show the information of any Job from my main method.

Job jobItem2 = new Job();
jobItem2._company = "Globant";
jobItem2._jobTitle = "Salesforce Developer";
jobItem2._startYear = 2025;
jobItem2._endYear = 2026;
jobItem2.display();
