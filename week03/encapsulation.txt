Explain the meaning of Encapsulation.
Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation.
Provide an application of Encapsulation.
Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
Thoroughly explain these concepts. (This likely cannot be done in less than 100 words.)

Encapsulation is separate the resposabilities of the class in different functions and handle what functions or variables should be public or for internal use (private).
With Encapsulationse can eccess to the class functionalities in a more organized way and secure, becouse all functions are not expose to other clases.

sometimes we want to hide funtionalities in our code, for example if we need to restructure data, we can do this in a private method because is no neede for other class to use that code. 
In my code I create a private method called CreateScripture, and i make it private because is spesific to instance the scripture class and add some values, this should only neede in my programm class so do not neet to be public.
